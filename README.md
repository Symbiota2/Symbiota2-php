## Welcome to the Symbiota2 development repository

Symbiota2 is currently under development. Though some portions of the application may work, the application as a whole is not ready for use. Symbiota2 uses the Symfony framework and requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [PHP 7.1 or greater](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) to be installed. In addition, the following PHP extensions need to be enabled:

- Ctype
- iconv
- JSON
- Mbstring
- OpenSSL
- PCRE
- PDO
- Session
- SimpleXML
- Tokenizer

[Symbiota2 can be installed for development following these steps](https://symbiota2.github.io/Symbiota2/setup/installation.html)
