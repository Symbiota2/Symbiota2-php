# Plugin project setup

**Before proceeding, be sure to have [installed and configured the Symbiota2 development environment](../setup/index.html).**

In order to setup a new plugin project, you must have a name for your plugin. [If you have not already, please read the 
 section on selecting a name for your plugin on the initial considerations page.](./initial_considerations.html)
 
If you have a name selected for your plugin, create a new directory in the `plugins` directory of your Symbiota2 installation
and name it the name you have selected for your plugin. This directory will serve as the root directory for your plugin 
project.
