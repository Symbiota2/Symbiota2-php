# Plugin registry

The plugin registry file serves to provide a universal list of optional plugins available to install on every 
Symbiota2 portal. While plugins can be installed that are not included in the registry, the registry provides a 
means to make a plugin easily accessible for installation in every instance of Symbiota2. The registry is an
array of [available plugin objects](./available-plugin-object.html).

**[Follow this link to view the current plugin registry.](https://github.com/Symbiota2/Symbiota2/blob/master/plugin-registry.json)**

If you would like to have your plugin added to the registry, please send us a pull request of your plugin added to the
file in alphabetical order by name.
