# Config file overview

The plugin config file is a JSON file that serves to provide a complete set of configuration settings that define how the
plugin will be integrated into the greater Symbiota2 software architecture. Each property of the config file corresponds to
a separate configuration setting for the plugin. Several of the properties are not required and should only be included 
in the config file if there are either backend or frontend components included within the plugin.

**[Follow this link to view the complete list of configuration settings in the config file.](./plugin-configuration-properties.html)**

Instructions in how to set specific configuration settings within the config file will be discussed in further parts of this
documentation.
